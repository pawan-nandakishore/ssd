# SSD Implementation

## Architecture
*I, gt =convnet=> F =shiftgen=>Bshift, B predict class_loss, reg_loss
* WHat is the ground truth input format?

## Aim
* Get a single square example working and show it to shashi
* Rotate it at different angles and get it working again

## Plan
* Code up all the methods in numpy
* Add correct sizes
* Write tests for all the methods today and check that they work
* Make all the code chainer friendly
* Test that methods still work
* Run backprop on pikachu dataset
